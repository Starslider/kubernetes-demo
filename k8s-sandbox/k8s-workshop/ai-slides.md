## Understanding Agentic AI and Modern AI Systems

A 30-Minute Introduction for Non-Technical Audiences

---

## Today's Journey

**Three Big Ideas:**

1. **Generative AI** - Technology that creates content
2. **Large Language Models (LLMs)** - AI that understands language
3. **Agentic AI** - AI that takes action

**Plus:** How they differ and why it matters

---

## Section 1
### What is Generative AI?

---

## The AI Evolution

**Traditional AI (2010s):**
- "Is this a cat or dog?" (Classification)
- "Will this customer buy?" (Prediction)

**Generative AI (2020s+):**
- "Write me a story about a cat"
- "Design a logo for my business"
- "Create a marketing campaign"

**The shift:** From analyzing → to creating

---

## What Does Generative AI Create?

**Content it generates:**
- Text (articles, emails, code)
- Images (art, photos, designs)
- Audio (music, voices)
- Video (animations, scenes)

**Examples you know:**
- ChatGPT, Claude (text)
- DALL-E, Midjourney (images)
- GitHub Copilot (code)

**Key insight:** Creates new content that didn't exist before

---

## How It Works (Simplified)

**Three Steps:**

1. **Training:** Learn from billions of examples
   - Read millions of books and websites
   - Study millions of images

2. **Pattern Recognition:** Build "knowledge" of patterns
   - What words go together?
   - What makes good content?

3. **Generation:** Create new content following patterns
   - Not copying—creating something new
   - Following learned "rules"

**Not magic:** Very sophisticated pattern matching at massive scale

---

## Generative AI: Strengths & Limits

**✅ Strengths:**
- Create content at scale and speed
- Available 24/7
- Consistent quality baseline

**⚠️ Limitations:**
- Can make factual errors ("hallucinations")
- No true understanding
- Reflects biases in training data
- Can't verify its own accuracy

**Remember:** Powerful tool, but requires human oversight

---

## Section 2
### Understanding Large Language Models

---

## What is an LLM?

**LLM = Large Language Model**

**"Large" means:**
- Trained on enormous amounts of text
- Billions of parameters (adjustable values)
- Requires massive computing power

**"Language Model" means:**
- Focused specifically on human language
- Understands and generates text
- Can translate, summarize, answer questions

**LLMs are a type of Generative AI specialized for language**

---

## Popular LLMs

**GPT-4** (OpenAI)
- Powers ChatGPT
- Most well-known

**Claude** (Anthropic)
- Longer conversations
- You're seeing it now in Claude Code!

**Gemini** (Google)
- Multimodal (text + images)

**LLaMA** (Meta)
- Open-source foundation

---

## How LLMs Generate Text

**Think of it like autocomplete on steroids:**

You type: "The cat sat on the..."

**Simple autocomplete:** "mat"

**LLM:** Predicts next words based on:
- Context of entire conversation
- Learned patterns from training
- Your specific question

**Result:** Can write paragraphs, articles, or code

**Key:** Predicting likely words, not "thinking"

---

## What LLMs Excel At

**Great for:**
- Answering questions
- Summarizing documents
- Writing content (emails, reports)
- Translation between languages
- Explaining complex topics
- Brainstorming ideas
- Writing and debugging code

**Current Limits:**
- Can make up facts confidently
- Math/logic errors possible
- Knowledge cutoff dates
- No true understanding

---

## Section 3
### What is Agentic AI?

---

## The Key Difference

**LLM (Conversational AI):**
- You: "Find me a restaurant for Friday"
- LLM: "I'd recommend checking OpenTable. Consider Italian restaurants..."
- **You still do all the work**

**Agent (Agentic AI):**
- You: "Find me a restaurant for Friday"
- Agent: *Checks your calendar → Searches restaurants → Makes reservation → Adds to calendar*
- **Agent does the work**

**The shift:** From assistant that talks → assistant that acts

---

## What is an AI Agent?

**An AI system that can:**

1. ✅ Understand a goal
2. 🧠 Plan steps to achieve it
3. 🛠️ Take actions autonomously
4. 📝 Learn from results
5. 🔄 Adapt its approach

**Key ingredient:** **Agency** = ability to act independently

**Analogy:**
- LLM = Expert consultant (gives advice)
- Agent = Employee (does the work)

---

## How Agents Work

**The Agent Loop:**

1. **Observe:** What's the current situation?
2. **Think:** What should I do next?
3. **Act:** Execute an action (use tools/APIs)
4. **Reflect:** Did that work?
5. **Repeat:** Until goal is achieved

**This is "agentic behavior":** Acting autonomously toward goals

---

## Agent Capabilities

**Agents can:**

**Use Tools:**
- Call APIs and web services
- Search databases
- Send emails/messages
- Run calculations

**Plan & Reason:**
- Break down complex problems
- Chain thoughts together
- Adapt when plans fail

**Remember:**
- Learn from past interactions
- Remember your preferences

---

## Real-World Agent Examples

**Customer Service Agent:**
- Understands your problem
- Searches knowledge base
- Provides solution
- Escalates if needed

**Coding Agent:**
- Understands feature request
- Writes code
- Tests it
- Fixes bugs

**Research Agent:**
- Given a topic
- Searches multiple sources
- Synthesizes findings
- Creates report

## Section 6
### Current State & Future

---

## Where We Are (2025)

**Reality Check:**

✅ **Agents can handle:**
- Well-defined tasks
- Clear success criteria
- Structured workflows

⚠️ **Agents struggle with:**
- Complex judgment calls
- Deep domain expertise
- Ambiguous goals
- Novel problem-solving

**Think of them as:** Smart interns, not experienced managers (yet)

---

## The Hallucination Challenge

**What are hallucinations?**
- AI confidently stating false information
- Making up facts or citations

**Why it happens:**
- Predicts likely text, not truth
- No built-in fact-checking

**Solution:**
- Give agents tools to verify facts
- Require citations
- Human review of critical outputs
- Don't trust blindly!

---

## Safety & Control

**The Human-in-the-Loop Approach:**

**Low-risk tasks:**
→ Full autonomy (fast)

**Medium-risk tasks:**
→ Human review before execution (balanced)

**High-risk tasks:**
→ Human decision-making (safe)

**Best practice:** Right balance of speed and safety for your use case

---

## Near Future (2025-2027)

**Expected advances:**
- Better reasoning and planning
- Longer memory (remember entire projects)
- More reliable tool use
- Improved fact-checking
- Better multi-agent collaboration

**Impact:** Handle increasingly complex workflows autonomously

**Reality:** Still augmenting humans, not replacing them
