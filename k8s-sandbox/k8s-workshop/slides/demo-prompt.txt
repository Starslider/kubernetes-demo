Build me a Snake game as a single HTML file. Make it visually polished with a dark theme, smooth animations, and mobile-friendly touch controls. Include a score counter, a high score that persists, increasing speed as the score goes up, and a game-over screen with a restart button. Add some particle effects when the snake eats food. The game should work immediately when opened in a browser. Save it to ~/Desktop/snake.html
